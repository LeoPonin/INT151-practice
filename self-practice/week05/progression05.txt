brute.js
I joined ctf compettion and some of the problem need to brute force to get the flag, I use python to solve them. Now i wonder, can I also use js?
so basically this code need to nc to the target address and brute foce their system. (the ip in this code is not real)
There are many of some weird things going here.

async In JavaScript, async is a keyword used to declare a function that always returns a Promise //AI
It seem like there are some state in the executed code, using async allow us to use await which pause the function execution until the "Promise" is resolved.

wth is Promise?
A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous operation. //AI
When we ask for something from server we dont get it immediately instead we get promise that say it's done, pending or rejected.
Well well well this seem to be something that's good to know since in frontend might deal with state quite often.
