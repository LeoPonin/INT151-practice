test2.js
tried to use the array method again. I forgot what each one can do in this file(actually forgot everything about jsğŸ˜«), so I tried using filter.
--------------------------
test11.js
let the AI generate a problem for me, and it had a hint saying to use map and filter.
So, I use filter to create a new array that filter only even num and then use map to create another new array of those even num and *2.
--------------------------
testpractice.js
kinda discover unfamilar things call forEach(quite complicated one). I splited strings into array of words.
Then do the loop with forEach
--------------------------
SO what i got????
filter-->creat a new array containing only the element that pass the condition
map-->create a new array that apply the function to each element
forEach-->check through each of element and do the things (do what function say)
im so bad at syntax stuff, this might be a huge problemğŸ’€ğŸ’€
